character-segmentation-evaluation
=================================

Research code for evaluating character segmentation results with three
different methods. It was used for gauging the performance of quad tree
segmentation.

This repository contains only the code used for generating the evaluation
results. Running it requires installing the Haskell platform and several
libraries. Detailed instructions will follow.

The code for the quad forest segmentation will be available soon as part of the
hs-cvsu library http://github.com/amnipar/hs-cvsu and a simple demonstration
program in c will be available soon as part of the cvsu library
